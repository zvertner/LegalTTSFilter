OPINION\
LUCAS, C.J.\
We granted review to consider the Court of Appeal's reversal of a directed verdict of coverage in favor of Jack and Rita Garvey (hereafter plaintiffs). We sought to resolve some of the confusion that has arisen regarding insurance coverage under the "all risk" section of a homeowner's insurance policy when loss to an insured's property can be attributed to two causes, one of which is a nonexcluded peril, and the other an excluded peril.\

\f0\i0 \strokec2  approach to coverage in first party cases effectively nullifies policy exclusions in "all risk" homeowner's property loss policies, thereby essentially abrogating the limiting terms of insurance contracts in such cases. We cannot believe

Plaintiffs bought their house in the mid-1970's. In 1977, plaintiffs purchased from State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (hereafter defendant) an "all risk" homeowner's policy of insurance which was in effect at all times relevant. Section I of the policy in question provided coverage for "all risks of physical loss to the property covered" except as otherwise excluded or limited. Losses excluded by this portion of the policy included those "caused by, resulting from, contributed to or aggravated by any earth movement, including but not limited to earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudflow, earth sinking, rising or shifting," and losses caused {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p400"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 400*400}} "by ... settling, cracking, shrinkage, bulging or expansion of pavements, patios, foundations, walls, floors, roofs or ceilings...."\
In August 1978, plaintiffs noticed that a house addition, built in the early 1960's, had begun to pull away from the main structure. They also discovered damage to a deck and garden wall. There ensued numerous phone calls, letters, meetings and investigations as plaintiffs tried to determine from defendant whether the damage was covered by their homeowner's property insurance policy.\
In October 1979, after receiving from its counsel an opinion that the loss was not covered, defendant notified plaintiffs by letter that the "policy excludes coverage for the loss herein. Normally, such a denial of coverage would leave you to your remedies. [\'b6] However, because the company wishes to resolve the coverage issue in an atmosphere free from extraneous matters such as bad-faith and class action issues, the company is prepared to advance you the claimed sum of $11,550 subject to a reservation of rights as authorized by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12701738578718788769&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Johansen v. CSAA, 15 Cal.3d 9}}...." Under the agreement proposed, defendant would make the advance and file a declaratory relief action on the issue of coverage; plaintiffs would pay back the advance if the court ruled in defendant's favor, would waive "any claim of consequential or punitive damages arising out of any allegation of bad-faith, mental distress, oppression, fraud or insurance-related tort," and would not "institute any class-action against defendant on account of the facts and issues involved in this loss and claim."\
After refusing to sign the foregoing agreement, plaintiffs sued, claiming that although their policy excluded coverage for losses caused or aggravated by earth movement, it implicitly provided coverage for losses caused by contractor negligence because negligence was not a specifically excluded peril under the policy. Plaintiffs also argued that defendant denied their claim before adequately investigating the damage to the structure, and that subsequent investigations were undertaken merely to confirm the original denial. In addition, plaintiffs asserted, defendant's denial of coverage constituted a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and violated various provisions of the Insurance Code. Plaintiffs sought as relief (i) policy benefits, (ii) general damages for economic detriment and emotional distress, and (iii) punitive damages.\
Defendant rested on the 12th day of trial, and the court granted a directed verdict for plaintiffs on the coverage issue. The court informed the parties it was following the decisions in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

\f2\i \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Sabella, supra,
\f0\i0  59 Cal.2d 21,}} and that plaintiffs were covered under the policy because negligent construction, a covered risk, was a concurrent {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p401"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 401*401}} proximate cause of the damage. Specifically, the trial court stated: "[The Supreme Court] told me in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  that negligent construction can be a proximate cause. They told me in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  there may be coverage whenever an insured risk constitutes simply a concurrent proximate cause of the injuries. [\'b6] Now, to me that is crystal clear, putting those two causes together, that if negligent construction is a concurrent proximate cause of the loss, there is coverage." The court continued, "The key witness for the defense, Mr. Nelson, conceded in his testimony, as I heard it and understood it, that the negligent construction was a cause of the room falling away. He did not use the word `proximate.' He said a causative factor at one time. I don't recall the exact language when he answered a question. In substance, that it was a cause on another occasion. As a matter of law, based upon the evidence, it was a proximate cause."\
The jury subsequently found defendant liable for $47,000 in policy benefits and general damages, and $1 million in punitive damages. The court denied defendant's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial, and declined to issue a remittitur with respect to the punitive damages award. The court entered judgment in accordance with the verdict. Defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in a divided opinion. Before reviewing the Court of Appeal holding, and in order to provide sufficient background information that will aid in the understanding of this case, we first discuss the development of multiple and concurrent causation insurance analyses, and the important distinction between property and liability policies.\

Our courts have long struggled to enunciate principles that determine whether coverage exists when excluded and covered perils interact to cause a loss. Initially, the courts attempted to reconcile section 530 (which provides for coverage when a peril insured against was the "proximate cause" of loss) with section 532 (which provides, that "If a peril is specifically excepted in a contract of insurance, and there is a loss which would not have occurred but for such peril, such loss is thereby excepted [from coverage] even though the immediate cause of the loss was a peril which was not excepted").\

Eventually, the sewer line ruptured causing water to saturate the ground surrounding the insureds' house, resulting in subsidence, an excluded peril. The insureds brought a first party action against their insurer, seeking recovery for property loss under their homeowner's property policy. (
\f2\i \strokec2 Id.,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  at p. 26.){\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#%5B4%5D"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs20 \cf3 \super \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 [4]}} The trial court found the loss was not covered because subsidence was a specifically excluded peril under the policy. The insureds appealed this ruling and we reversed.\
(3) On its face, section 532 would have precluded coverage because the loss would not have occurred "but for" the excluded peril of subsidence. We recognized, however, that such a result would be absurd because it would deny coverage even though an insured peril "proximately" caused the loss simply because a subsequent, excepted peril was also part of the chain of causation. We reasoned that sections 530 and 532 were not intended to deny coverage for losses whenever "an excepted peril operated to any extent in the chain of causation so that the resulting harm would not have occurred `but for' the excepted peril's operation...." ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1301700387476487943&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt 
\f2\i \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Sabella, supra,
\f0\i0  59 Cal.2d at p. 33}}.) Rather, we explained that when section 532 is read along with section 530, the "but for" clause of section 532 necessarily refers to a "proximate cause" of the loss, and the "immediate cause" refers to the cause most immediate in time to the damage. (
\f2\i \strokec2 Id.,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  at pp. 33-34.)\
Thus, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  held that: "`[I]n determining whether a loss is within an exception in a policy, where there is a concurrence of different causes, the efficient cause \'97 the one that sets others in motion \'97 is the cause to which the loss is to be attributed, though the other causes may follow it, and operate more immediately in producing the disaster.'" ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1301700387476487943&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 59 Cal.2d at pp. 31-32,}} quoting from Couch on Insurance (1930) \'a7 1466; Houser & Kent,

Furthermore, in characterizing the "but for" clause of section 532 as referring to the efficient proximate cause of the loss, we impliedly recognized that coverage would not exist if the covered risk was simply a

In 1973, we were faced with a third party tort liability situation that presented a "novel question of insurance coverage" and did not fit the

\f2\i \strokec2 liability
\f0\i0 \strokec2  policy with comprehensive personal liability coverage. (The latter liability policy excluded losses "arising out of the use" of a motor vehicle.) The insured, after filing the trigger mechanism of his pistol to create a "hair-trigger" action (such negligence was a covered risk under the homeowner's property policy), hunted jackrabbits at night from his vehicle. As he drove over rough terrain while waving the gun in his hand (negligent driving was an excluded risk under homeowner's liability policy), the gun fired and injured a passenger.\
First party property coverage issues were not involved. The case concerned the personal 
\f2\i \strokec2 liability
\f0\i0 \strokec2  of the insured who was sued by his injured passenger. Both policies were issued by the same insurer, which conceded the accident was covered under the automobile liability policy.

\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2 ] is not very helpful, for here both causes were independent of each other: the filing of the trigger did not `cause' the careless driving, nor vice versa. Both, however, caused the injury.... If committed by separate individuals, both actors would be joint tortfeasors fully liable for the resulting injuries. Moreover, the fact that both acts were committed by a single person does not alter their nature as concurrent proximate causes. (Cf., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7962605205417242126&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

Because 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  dealt with causation in the context of third party liability insurance, we did not address, nor did we contemplate, the application of our decision to the determination of coverage in the first party property insurance context. Indeed, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  asserted only that the "concurrent cause" standard was "consistent with Insurance Code sections 530 and 532, as authoritatively construed in

Furthermore,

\f0\i0 \strokec2  the "novel question" of liability coverage presented because two separate acts of negligence simultaneously joined together to cause an injury, we also impliedly recognized the limited scope of our holding. We did not extend our holding to first party property insurance cases. Accordingly, we should not apply the decision to such cases merely because it appears to simplify the coverage analysis.\

As we will demonstrate, the decision of the Court of Appeal, in applying the 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  concurrent causation analysis to property damage cases, like other recent insurance cases involving all-risk homeowner's policies, failed to differentiate between property loss coverage under a first party policy and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p406"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 406*406}} tort liability coverage under a third party policy of insurance. (5) First- and third party coverage is today typically provided in a single policy, and under both types of coverage, once the insured shows that an event falls within the scope of basic coverage under the policy, the burden is on the insurer to prove a claim is specifically excluded. (See {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5099814393797767768&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

(See {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13129939319740042571&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

(7) The scope of coverage and the operation of the exclusion clauses, however, are different in the separate policy portions and should be treated as such. As one commentator has recently stated: "Liability and corresponding coverage under a third party insurance policy must be carefully distinguished from the coverage analysis applied in a first party property contract. Property insurance, unlike liability insurance, is unconcerned with establishing negligence or otherwise assessing tort liability." (Bragg, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Concurrent Causation and the Art of Policy Drafting: New Perils for Property Insurers
\f0\i0 \strokec2  (1985) 20 Forum 385, 386.)\
For these reasons it is important to separate the causation analysis necessary in a first party property loss case from that which must be undertaken in a third party tort liability case. The following quotation summarizes the distinction that must be drawn: "Property insurance ... is an agreement, a contract, in which the insurer agrees to indemnify the insured in the event that the insured property suffers a covered loss. Coverage, in turn, is commonly provided by reference to causation, e.g., `loss caused by ...' certain enumerated perils. [\'b6] The term `perils' in traditional property insurance parlance refers to fortuitous, active, physical forces such as lightning, wind, and explosion, which bring about the loss. 
\f2\i \strokec2 Thus, the `cause' of loss in the context of a property insurance contract is totally different from that in a liability policy.
\f0\i0 \strokec2  This distinction is critical to the resolution of losses involving multiple causes. [\'b6] Frequently property losses occur which involve more than one peril that might be considered legally significant. If one of the causes (perils) arguably falls within the coverage grant \'97 commonly either because it is specifically insured (as in a named peril policy) or not specifically excepted or excluded (as in an "all risks" policy) \'97 disputes over coverage can arise. The task becomes one of identifying the most important cause of the loss and attributing the loss to that cause." (Bragg, 
\f2\i \strokec2 supra,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  20 Forum at pp. 386-387, italics added.)\
\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p407"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 407*407}} On the other hand, the right to coverage in the third party liability insurance context draws on traditional tort concepts of fault, proximate cause and duty. This liability analysis differs substantially from the coverage analysis in the property insurance context, which draws on the relationship between perils that are either covered or excluded in the contract. In liability insurance, by insuring for personal liability, and agreeing to cover the insured for his own negligence, the insurer agrees to cover the insured for a broader spectrum of risks. In order to further demonstrate the differences between property loss and liability coverage, we compare two sections of a typical homeowner's policy \'97 the all-risk property loss coverage section of the policy in this case and the personal liability section at issue in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#%5B6%5D"}}{\fldrslt 
\f0\i0\fs20 \cf3 \super \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 [6]}}
\f0\i0 \strokec2 \
Each policy section is governed by separate exclusions. For example, the all-risk first party property loss coverage section in this case provides for coverage against "all risk of physical loss" except: losses "caused by ... settling cracking, shrinkage, bulging or expansion of pavements, patios, foundations, walls, floors, roofs or ceilings...."\
In comparison, in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  "The coverage clause of the `Personal Liability' section of the `Homeowner's Policy' provides in relevant part: `This Company agrees to pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury or property damage, to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence.' ..." ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 10 Cal.3d at p. 99, fn. 5}}.) Moreover, "[t]he applicable exclusionary clause reads: `This policy does not apply: 1. Under Coverage E \'97 Personal Liability ... (a) To Bodily Injury or Property Damage Arising Out of the Ownership, Maintenance, Operation, Use, Loading or Unloading of: ... (2) Any Motor Vehicle Owned or Operated By, or Rented or Loaned to, any Insured....'" ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 10 Cal.3d at p. 99, fn. 6}}.)\
As the two provisions cited above illustrate, under the all-risk first party property policy, because generally "all risk of physical loss" is covered, the exclusions become the limitation on loss coverage. Under the liability portion {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p408"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 408*408}} of the policy, on the other hand, the focus is, at least initially, on the insured's legal obligation to pay for injury or damage arising out of an "occurrence."\
In the property insurance context, the insurer and the insured can tailor the policy according to the selection of insured and excluded risks and, in the process, determine the corresponding premium to meet the economic needs of the insured. On the other hand, if the insurer is expected to cover claims that are outside the scope of the first party property loss policy, an "all risk" policy would become an "all loss" policy. (Friedman, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Concurrent Causation: The Coverage Trap
\f0\i0 \strokec2  (1985) 86 Best's Rev.: Prop./Casualty 50, 58.) In most instances, the insured can point to some arguably covered contributing factor. As we shall discuss, if the rule in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt 
\f2\i \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Partridge, supra,
\f0\i0  10 Cal.3d 94,}} were extended to first party cases, the presence of such a cause, no matter how minor, would give rise to coverage.\
Finally, as we explain, the reasonable expectations of the insurer and the insured in the first party property loss portion of a homeowner's policy \'97 as manifested in the distribution of risks, the proportionate premiums charged and the coverage for all risks except those specifically excluded \'97 cannot reasonably include an expectation of coverage in property loss cases in which the efficient proximate cause of the loss is an activity expressly 
\f2\i \strokec2 excluded
\f0\i0 \strokec2  under the policy. Indeed, if we were to approve of the trial court's directed verdict, we would be requiring ordinary insureds to bear the expense of increased premiums necessitated by the erroneous expansion of their insurers' potential liabilities.

\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  to liability cases, the court did attempt to limit the scope of 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2 's concurrent causation standard in both liability and property cases by requiring the included and excluded perils to be independent of origin 
\f2\i \strokec2 and
\f0\i0 \strokec2  independent in operation. Specifically, the Court of Appeal interpreted {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

\f0\i0  10 Cal.3d 94,}} as holding that "because each act could have caused the loss regardless of the existence of the other act [citation], they were independent of each other." According to the Court of Appeal: "Neither [cause in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2 ] can be said to have necessarily acted upon a condition created by the other, or to have propelled the other, or to have brought to fruition the potential for damage inherent in the other." The Court of Appeal believed the "
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  court would not have found the covered risk to be `independent' if that risk (negligence) existed only in relation to, [or was dependent on] an excluded risk." Thus, the Court of Appeal determined that in order for coverage to be found under 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  the concurrent event 
\f2\i \strokec2 alone
\f0\i0 \strokec2  must have been a "sufficient condition" of the loss \'97 i.e., capable of producing damage itself.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#%5B8%5D"}}{\fldrslt

The Court of Appeal determined that the jury in the present case {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p410"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 410*410}} must decide the coverage issue because it was not clear, as a matter of law, whether the two risks were dependent on or independent of each other.\

\f0\i0 \strokec2  specifically stated that "the twin causes in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge

(9) Finally, because we believe the 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  analysis should be limited to third party liability cases, we cannot sustain the directed verdict in this case. Plaintiffs argue the directed verdict was proper because there was no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a determination other than the following: the included risk of negligent construction and the excluded risk of earth movement in the form of soil creep, if any, were independent, concurrent proximate causes of the loss plaintiffs sustained to their property.\
We disagree. The record does not support either plaintiffs' contention or the hyperbolic characterization of the expert testimony in Justice Mosk's dissent. The record discloses that the experts were in marked disagreement as to the causes of plaintiffs' damages. For example, Mr. Nelson, the defense expert, testified: "There was settlement and creep. The room addition moved away from the house and was caused by \'97 probably caused by settlement and creep." Plaintiffs' expert, Mr. Hillebrandt testified to the contrary. To the question, "Was what happened to the room addition in August 1978 related to any respect to soil creep, in your opinion?" Hillebrandt replied, "In my opinion, it didn't. And the reason is because the actual breaking \'97 the footing of the support beam was actually on a level surface. It was on a level fill surface that had been placed behind the rock wall, and the whole hillside may have been creeping, but this was just one part of it, and it was a level surface." At another point during the trial, however, Hillebrandt testified that the damage to the deck was caused by the following: "In this case, the footing [of the retaining wall] was not deep enough, so consequently, when the creep forces at the surface caused this downhill movement, the footing just went along for the ride."\
This case presents a classic 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  situation. Coverage should be determined by a jury under an efficient proximate cause analysis. Accordingly, bearing in mind the facts here, we conclude the question of causation is for the jury to decide.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#%5B11%5D"}}{\fldrslt

\f2\i \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Sabella, supra,
\f0\i0  59 Cal.2d 21}}. On the other hand, if negligence was the efficient proximate cause of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p413"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 413*413}} loss, then coverage exists under 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella.

KAUFMAN, J.\
I concur with the majority's conclusion that the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict in favor of plaintiffs on the coverage issue and that the cause must be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. However, I cannot subscribe fully to the analysis and reasoning of the majority opinion and am concerned that they are erroneous in part and will lead to yet further confusion in this seemingly perplexing area of the law. I therefore separately concur.\
The majority posits that the confusion evidenced in the reported decisions results from the failure to distinguish between first party and third party cases. The majority appears to hold that the "efficient proximate cause" or "predominant cause" analysis of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1301700387476487943&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2 ) is applicable in all first party cases and that the concurrent-cause analysis of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2 ) is not applicable in first party cases except perhaps, as I understand it, where the concurrent causes are truly independent of each other and neither one can fairly said to be the "efficient" or "predominant" cause of the loss. Although, the majority opinion does not expressly say so, it leaves the impression that the concurrent-causation rule of 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  is applicable to third party cases.\
While I recognize important differences between property damage insurance and liability insurance and first party and third party cases, I am doubtful that those differences compel or warrant two separate and entirely different rules for ascertaining the coverage provided by the two kinds of policies. In my view, the confusion in this area of the law results primarily from two major flaws in the 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  decision which have made it all but impossible to reconcile with 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  and which ought to be recognized and disapproved.\
The first flaw in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  is, as the majority suggests, that it imported into the determination of coverage, concepts and rules of tort law inapplicable {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p414"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 414*414}} to the contractual question of the coverage afforded by an insurance policy, and, based on them, adopted the tort rule of concurrent causation to determine coverage. One of the principal rationalizations for the rule announced in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  was that if two different persons had separately performed the two negligent acts involved therein, ((1) filing down the gun's trigger to a hair trigger and (2) driving the vehicle off the road over rough terrain with the gun pointed at the passenger), each actor as a joint tortfeasor would have been liable. Therefore, if the trigger filer had a homeowner's policy including personal liability coverage and the vehicle driver had auto liability insurance, both insurers would have been obliged to indemnify their respective insureds in respect to a judgment against them.\
That rationalization accurately reflected tort law, but it failed entirely to recognize that the problem before the court in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  was not the joint and several liability of joint tortfeasors, but the interpretation of a homeowner's policy owned by the single tortfeasor, which expressly excluded any injury arising out of the use of a motor vehicle. One might ask what the situation would have been if there were in fact two tortfeasors but the vehicle driver had only a homeowner's policy and the trigger filer had only an automobile liability insurance policy. Both tortfeasors would still have been liable under tort law, but neither policy would have afforded coverage for the conduct of the insured and neither insurer would have had any liability. The point is that tort liability on the part of the insured does not establish liability on the part of the insurer unless the policy affords coverage for the conduct of the insured and that is to be determined by contract principles, not tort principles, in both first party and third party cases.\
There are to be sure substantial differences between property damage insurance and liability insurance and first party and third party cases. To start with, coverage in property damage insurance is typically phrased in terms of injury caused by certain "risks" or "perils" set forth in the policy, whereas coverage in liability insurance is typically couched in terms of the insured's liability for loss resulting from "an occurrence" as defined in the policy. Because of this difference it may be that the reasonable expectations of insureds will be different under property damage and liability insurance policies. Further, there is a public policy consideration involved in coverage determinations under liability policies that may not be involved in coverage determinations under property damage policies: third party injury and the potential burden on the public fisc in the absence of compensation. These differences and perhaps others may legitimately affect the determination of coverage. But the question of coverage in both first party and third party cases is a contract question and must be determined under contract principles.

The other major flaw in the 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  decision is that it mischaracterized the causes of the injury in that case as "independent" and therefore misapplied the rule it was attempting to announce. If there could be a case in which the concurrent causation rule might be appropriate it would be where the causes of the injury were 
\f2\i \strokec2 truly independent of each other
\f0\i0 \strokec2  and related to the injury in such a way that neither could fairly be said to be the "efficient" or "predominant" cause. (See maj. opn. p. 409, 
\f2\i \strokec2 ante,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  fn. 8.)\
But that was not the case in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge.
\f0\i0 \strokec2  There the filing of the trigger had set the stage all right; it was in fact an accident waiting to happen. But the hair trigger was activated by the other cause, the bumping and bouncing of the vehicle as it was driven off the pavement over the rough and bumpy ground in pursuit of jackrabbits with the gun pointed at the passenger. Thus, under 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  principles it was the negligent driving of the vehicle over the rough terrain with the gun pointed at the passenger that was the "efficient" or "predominant" cause of the injury and coverage for such accidental injury arising out of the use of a vehicle was expressly excluded by the homeowner's policy. Where the court in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  went wrong is readily apparent. It looked to the absence of interrelationship between 
\f2\i \strokec2 the two acts of negligence
\f0\i0 \strokec2  and concluded 
\f2\i \strokec2 they
\f0\i0 \strokec2  were independent ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

\f0\i0  10 Cal.3d at p. 104, fn. 10}} ["... [T]here both causes were independent of each other: the filing of the trigger did not `cause' the careless driving, nor vice versa."].)\
It is not enough, however, that the negligent acts are independent. That is frequently the case. The minimum requirement that could make the 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  concurrent cause rule appropriate would be that the concurrent causes of the injury were wholly independent of each other and related to the injury in such a way that neither could fairly be said to be the "efficient" or "predominant" cause of the injury. (See e.g., maj. opn. p. 409, fn. 8.) This analytic fault in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  has led a number of courts to misconstrue 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2 's "independence" requirement and thus erroneously to apply the 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  rule. (See e.g., {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11727706705589930787&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

\f0\i0 \strokec2  Because of the importance and evident difficulty of the question, the court has decided to address the matter anew. As I shall explain, I am of the opinion that the rule is as follows: When two risks, one included within the coverage of the policy and the other excluded, concur as proximate causes in producing a loss and are dependent \'97 i.e., when one sets the other in motion \'97 there is coverage if the included risk triggers the excluded, but not if the excluded triggers the included.

In 1974 plaintiffs Jack and Rita Garvey purchased a house in Fairfax. It appears that the house was built prior to 1938; it sat on a hill, with a downslope to the rear; a rock wall of unknown age was located on the downslope; at some time before 1960, a deck was constructed below the southeast corner of the house; in 1960, a room addition was built onto the lower southwest portion of the house on level ground. At all times relevant herein Mr. Garvey was a lawyer and a professor of law.\
In 1977 plaintiffs purchased from defendant State Farm Fire and Casualty Company a policy of homeowner's insurance, which was in effect at all times relevant. The policy was what is commonly known as an "all risk" policy \'97 i.e., a policy that covers all perils generally and without enumeration except those specifically excepted, as opposed to the typical policy which specifies both included and excluded perils. The policy in question provided coverage for "all risk of physical loss," except the following: losses "caused by, resulting from, contributed to or aggravated by any earth movement, including but not limited to earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudflow, earth sinking, rising or shifting," and losses caused "by ... settling, cracking, shrinkage, bulging or expansion of pavements, patios, foundations, walls, floors, roofs or ceilings...."\
In August 1978 the room addition, which was built on level ground, separated from the main structure. It was subsequently discovered that the room had neither a foundation nor any structural connection to the house. Around the same time plaintiffs found that the deck constructed below their house had suffered damage.\
Plaintiffs undertook to determine from defendant whether the loss they had sustained was covered by their homeowner's insurance policy, and eventually submitted a claim for $11,550. Over a period of many months defendant investigated the matter; over the same period Mr. Garvey and defendant's counsel disputed about the law that should govern the determination of the claim. Plaintiffs became dissatisfied with the pace of the investigation and advised defendant that they might institute class-action litigation involving breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p418"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 418*418}} regard to its interpretation of the earth movement exclusion of the homeowner's policy.\
In October 1979, after receiving from counsel an opinion that the loss was not covered, defendant notified plaintiffs by letter that the "policy excludes coverage for the loss herein. Normally, such a denial of coverage would leave you to your remedies. [\'b6] However, because the company wishes to resolve the coverage issue in an atmosphere free from extraneous matters such as bad-faith and class-action issues, the company is prepared to advance you the claimed sum of $11,550 subject to a reservation of rights as authorized by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12701738578718788769&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Johansen v. CSAA, 15 Cal.3d 9, 123 Cal. Rptr. 288}}." Under the agreement proposed, defendant would make the advance and file a declaratory relief action on the issue of coverage; and plaintiffs would pay back the advance if the court ruled in defendant's favor, would waive "any claim of consequential or punitive damages arising out of any allegation of bad-faith, mental distress, oppression, fraud or insurance-related tort," and would not "institute any class-action against defendant on account of the facts and issues involved in this loss and claim."\
Thereupon, plaintiffs filed the complaint in this action. They asserted against defendant the following causes of action, among others. First, they alleged that defendant had breached its obligations under the policy to pay for the loss they had sustained to their property. They next alleged that defendant had violated the covenant of good faith and fair dealing both in its decision to deny their claim and in its general handling of the matter, including the tendering of the so-called "
\f2\i \strokec2 Johansen
\f0\i0 \strokec2 " agreement; they further stated that defendant's conduct caused them emotional distress; they also stated that defendant acted with intent to oppress and defraud. Plaintiffs further alleged that defendant violated various provisions of the Insurance Code, both in its decision to deny the claim and in its general handling of the matter, and that it thereby caused them emotional distress; they further stated that defendant acted with intent to oppress and defraud. Plaintiffs prayed for compensatory damages for economic and noneconomic injury; they also prayed for punitive damages.\
Trial was by jury. Plaintiffs' expert, Donald H. Hillebrandt, and defendant's expert, Jay A. Nelson, agreed that negligent construction was a direct and substantial cause of the loss that plaintiffs sustained to their property. For example, Hillebrandt responded to the question, "In your opinion, is there any particular reason that the [room] addition gave way when it did as opposed to two years earlier or two years later or some other time?," as follows: "Not really.... [I]t was just kind of a failure waiting to happen, and it's hard to say what triggered it. It was basically faulty construction and at some given time \'97 you know, sometimes if these things occur during {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p419"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 419*419}} the winter you can kind of say, well, maybe the soil was soft or weak or \'97 but this, in my understanding, occurred during the summer in the dry season. So it was tacked on there, it reached a point where it was over stressed. The nails couldn't hold it any more, there were no ties at the foundation level, no ties at the roof level, no ties at the floor level, and it just fell away." Nelson testified to similar effect. "[B]ad construction," he stated, "was one reason why [the room addition] settled."\
The experts did not agree, however, as to whether and if so to what extent earth movement played a part. For example, Nelson stated soil creep was a cause of the separation of the room addition from the main structure. Hillebrandt testified to the contrary. To the question, "Was what happened to the room addition in August of 1978 related to any respect to soil creep, in your opinion?," Hillebrandt responded: "In my opinion, it didn't. And the reason is because the actual breaking \'97 the footing of the support beam was actually on a level surface. It was on a level fill surface that had been placed behind the rock wall, and the whole hillside may have been creeping, but this was just one part of it, and it was a level surface." Nelson testified that although he believed both negligent construction and soil creep were causes of the loss to the room addition, he could not make a determination as to their relative order or significance: "Well, it all goes back to the chicken or the egg. I mean, which comes first."\
Plaintiffs also introduced evidence to show that defendant breached its obligations under the terms of the policy, the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and the Insurance Code not only by its decision to deny the claim but also by its handling of the matter generally.\
After the parties rested, on plaintiffs' motion the trial court directed a verdict in their favor on the issue of coverage. In support of the ruling, it stated: "[The Supreme Court] told me in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  that negligent construction can be a proximate cause. They told me in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  there may be coverage whenever an insured risk constitutes simply a concurrent proximate cause of the injuries. [\'b6] Now, to me that is crystal clear, putting those two causes together, that if negligent construction is a concurrent proximate cause of the loss, there is coverage." The court continued: "The key witness for the defense, Mr. Nelson, conceded in his testimony, as I heard it and understood it, that the negligent construction was a cause of the room falling away. He did not use the word `proximate.' He said a causative factor at one time. I don't recall the exact language when he answered a question. In substance, that it was a cause on another occasion. As a matter of law, based upon the evidence, it was a proximate cause."\
The trial court subsequently instructed the jury with regard to the remaining issues in the case. Because plaintiffs' allegation of, and evidence on, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p420"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 420*420}} "bad faith" related to conduct other than the actual decision to deny the claim, the court charged the jurors that the "ruling directing a verdict of the issue of coverage shall have no bearing on any issue remaining in this case." It further instructed them that "An attorney has the right to give a legal opinion to his client. The mere fact that the attorney's opinion turns out later to be erroneous does not by itself make the giving of the opinion unreasonable or constitute evidence of bad faith on the part of the client." It went on: "Therefore, you should concern yourself not with the correctness or incorrectness of the legal point of view of the attorney, but with whatever circumstances, if any, you find relevant which bear upon the state of mind of the attorney at the time."\
The jury rendered a general verdict in favor of plaintiffs and against defendant, and assessed damages in the amount of $1,047,593. As its answers to special interrogatories reveal, the jury found that defendant had breached both the terms of the policy (thereby entitling plaintiffs to compensatory damages in the amount of $19,790) and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing (thereby entitling them to compensatory damages in the amount of $27,803). It also found that defendant was liable for punitive damages, and assessed the amount at $1 million. The court entered judgment in accordance with the verdict. From that judgment defendant appealed.\
On appeal, the parties raised several contentions. Some went to the issue of coverage and to the directed verdict; others went to other issues.\
By a two-to-one vote, the Court of Appeal reversed. At the threshold the majority rejected defendant's claims that 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  is applicable only to third party liability policies and that in any event negligence could not be deemed a risk included within the coverage of the policy.\
Reviewing 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  and 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  and many of the cases in which those decisions had been construed and applied, the Court of Appeal majority fashioned the following interpretation of 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  and 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2 : "[W]hether the covered risk and excluded risk are causes in fact should be a court's threshold inquiry.... If (i) they both are causes in fact and if the two risks are independent of each other, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  analysis is triggered: the insured is covered if the covered risk was a concurring proximate cause of the loss. If (ii) the two risks are dependent on each other, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  analysis is triggered: the insured is covered only if the covered risk was the moving cause of the loss." Crucial to the majority's interpretation was the meaning it gave to the term "independent": causes are independent when they are of separate origin 
\f2\i \strokec2 and are each a sufficient condition of the loss in question.

It reasoned as follows: "It may be that the loss was due to the fact that the covered risk (negligent construction of the house addition) was dependent on the excluded risk (earth movement). In other words, if the negligently constructed house addition was the agency through which the earth movement caused the loss, then coverage would be denied under 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella.
\f0\i0 \strokec2  On the other hand, if the house addition was negligently constructed such that the addition is what caused the earth to move with the resulting loss, then coverage exists. Finally, if the earth was caused to move independent of the house addition and the addition was tearing away from the house independent of the earth movement, with the two happening to join together to cause the loss, then coverage exists. All of these issues were jury questions because sufficient evidence was introduced to support all three possibilities."\
The majority did not address any other contentions raised by the parties going to the issue of coverage, and did not reach any of the contentions bearing on other issues. It reasoned that because it had held that the directed verdict on coverage was error, "the entire judgment must be reversed (see {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12701738578718788769&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

Finding that the majority's "newly discovered independence requirement is neither mandated by, nor is it consistent with, the decision in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge,"
\f0\i0 \strokec2  the dissenting member of the Court of Appeal read the cases as follows:

\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge

In 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  the insurer issued to the insureds a fire insurance policy on their house containing an "`All Physical Loss' Building Endorsement." Under the endorsement, the insurer agreed to insure the house "against all {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p422"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 422*422}} risks of physical loss except as hereinafter excluded." In the subdivision "Exclusions," it was stated: "This endorsement does not insure against loss ... by ... settling...." Subsequently, the house suffered damage that was caused by settling, which in turn was caused by the rupture of a sewer line attributable to the negligence of the builder and the consequent emptying of waste water into loose fill on which the house was built. Thereupon, the insureds brought an action against the insurer, among others, seeking recovery for their loss. Determining that the insurer was exempt from liability under the policy because the loss was caused by "settling" within the meaning of the exclusion clause, the trial court entered judgment in its favor.\
Having granted a hearing in the matter, we reversed. Our reasoning was as follows. "Plaintiff [insureds] ... correctly argue ... that defendant [insurer] is liable because the rupture of the sewer line attributable to the negligence of a third party, rather than settling, was the efficient proximate cause of the loss. The policy excepted 
\f2\i \strokec2 loss by settling,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  and the findings of the court below indicate that the broken sewer line emptied waste water into the loose fill, setting in motion the forces tending toward settlement. As stated in 6 Couch, Insurance (1930) \'a7 1466, `[I]n determining whether a loss is within an exception in a policy, where there is a concurrence of different causes, the efficient cause \'97 the one that sets others in motion \'97 is the cause to which the loss is to be attributed, though the other causes may follow it, and operate more immediately in producing the disaster.' ...\
".... .... .... .... ....\
"Defendant insurer attempts to establish its non-liability by reliance upon section 532 of the Insurance Code, which states that `If a peril is specially excepted in a contract of insurance and there is a loss which would not have occurred but for such peril, such loss is thereby excepted even though the immediate cause of the loss was a peril which was not excepted.' The insurer's argument is that since in a factual sense the loss herein would not have occurred `but for' the settling of the underlying earth and house, the plaintiffs are thereby exempt from coverage for this loss. But section 532 must be read in conjunction with related section 530 of the Insurance Code ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=673014080029804398&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

\f2\i Williamsburgh City Fire Ins. Co.

It is thus apparent that if section 532 were construed in the manner contended for by defendant insurer, where an excepted peril operated to any extent in the chain of causation so that the resulting harm {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p423"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 423*423}} would not have occurred `but for' the excepted peril's operation, the insurer would be exempt even though an insured peril was the proximate cause of the loss. Such a result would be directly contrary to the provision in section 530, in accordance with the general rule, for liability of the insurer where the peril insured against proximately resulted in the loss[.] [Citation.]\
"It would appear therefore that the specially excepted peril alluded to in section 532 as that `but for' which the loss would not have occurred, is the peril proximately causing the loss [citation], and the peril there referred to as the `immediate cause of the loss' is that which is immediate in time to the occurrence of the damage." ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1301700387476487943&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 59 Cal.2d at pp. 31-34}}.)\
In 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  the insurer issued to the insured a "Homeowner's Policy," which contained, in addition to the normal coverage against fire and theft, a common comprehensive "personal liability" provision generally covering the insured for all personal liability not falling within specified exclusions. Among the exclusions was "Bodily Injury ... Arising Out of the ... Use ... of ... Any Motor Vehicle...."\
One evening, the insured took two friends, Vanida Neilson and Ray Albertson, out for a drive in the countryside in his four-wheel-drive Ford Bronco. With Vanida sitting between them in the front seat, the insured and Albertson hunted jackrabbits by shooting out of the windows of the moving vehicle; the insured was using a .357-caliber Magnum pistol whose trigger mechanism he had filed to produce a "hair trigger action." As he was driving, the insured spotted a jackrabbit running across the road and \'97 in order to keep the animal within the range of his headlights \'97 steered the vehicle off the pavement onto the adjacent rough terrain. He hit a bump; the pistol \'97 which he was then holding in his lap or on top of the steering wheel pointed in Vanida's direction \'97 discharged; and a bullet penetrated through the woman's left arm and down to her spinal cord and caused paralysis. Vanida then filed a personal injury action against the insured.\
Thereupon, the insurer brought a declaratory judgment action, claiming inter alia that it was exempt from liability under the homeowner's policy through the operation of the "use-of-a-motor-vehicle" exclusion. The trial court disagreed. It first found that the insured had been negligent both in modifying the pistol and in driving his vehicle off the paved road onto the rough terrain. It also found that these two negligent acts were independent, concurrent proximate causes of Vanida's injuries. Finally, it concluded, inter alia, that the homeowner's policy afforded coverage. Accordingly, it entered judgment holding the insurer liable.\
Having granted a hearing in the matter, we affirmed. Our reasoning was as follows. "[T]he crucial question presented is whether a liability insurance {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p424"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 424*424}} policy provides coverage for an accident caused jointly by an insured risk (the negligent filing of the trigger mechanism) and by an excluded risk (the negligent driving).

\f2\i Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.
\f0\i0  (1945) 27 Cal.2d 305 [163 P.2d 689]}} this court faced a somewhat similar problem of determining insurance coverage in a case involving a multiplicity of causes. In 
\f2\i \strokec2 Brooks,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  an insured, afflicted with debilitating cancer, was covered by an accident policy which excluded `"injury... [or] death ... caused wholly or partly, directly or indirectly, by disease or mental infirmity...."' [Citation.] The insured died in a fire, and the insurer sought to escape liability by establishing that a healthy individual would not have perished and thus that the insured's infirm condition did contribute to his death. While acknowledging that the insured's condition did contribute to his death, our court rejected the insurer's contention that coverage was unavailable simply because one of two joint causes of the death was an excluded risk. Chief Justice Gibson, writing for a unanimous court, declared that under such circumstances `the presence of preexisting disease or infirmity will not relieve the insurer from liability 
\f2\i \strokec2 if the accident is the proximate cause of death
\f0\i0 \strokec2  ... [R]ecovery may be had even though a diseased or infirm condition appears to actually contribute to cause the death if the accident sets in progress the chain of events leading directly to death, or if it is the prime or moving cause.' [Citation.] The court accordingly permitted recovery under the policy.\
"The rationale of the

\f0\i0 \strokec2  decision equally applies to the instant case. Here, as in

\f0\i0  (1963) 59 Cal.2d 21, 31-32 [27 Cal. Rptr. 689, 377 P.2d 889]}}, the court, quoting 6 Couch on Insurance (1930) section 1466, restated the 
\f2\i \strokec2 Brooks
\f0\i0 \strokec2  principle in terms of `efficient cause': `"[I]n determining whether a loss is within an exception in a policy, where there is a concurrence of different causes, the efficient cause \'97 the one that sets others in motion \'97 is the cause to which the loss is attributed, though the other causes may follow it, and operate more immediately in producing the disaster."' In 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  although damage to an insured dwelling resulted from `settling,' an excluded risk, the court found that the settling, in turn, had resulted directly from leakage from a broken sewer pipe, an insured risk; on these facts the `efficient cause' terminology was useful, because the court could find that the break in the pipe `set the other cause,' settling, `in motion.' [Citations.]\
"In the instant case, however, the `efficient cause' language is not very helpful, for here both causes were independent of each other: the filing of the trigger did not `cause' the careless driving, nor vice versa. Both, however, caused the injury. In traditional tort jargon, both are concurrent proximate causes of the accident, the negligent driving constituting an intervening, but non-superseding, cause of the accident." ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 10 Cal.3d at p. 104, fn. 10}}.)\
In footnote 11, we stated as follows. "Our conclusion that coverage is available whenever an insured risk constitutes a proximate cause of an accident, even if an excluded risk is a concurrent proximate cause, is consistent with Insurance Code sections 530 and 532, as authoritatively construed in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1301700387476487943&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

\f0\i0 \strokec2 )....\
"In interpreting these two sections in light of one another, the 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  court rejected the insurer's contention that coverage was unavailable whenever an excluded risk constituted a `but for' cause of an accident. The 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  court declared: `[I]f section 532 were construed in the manner contended for by defendant insurer, where an excepted peril operated to any extent in the chain of causation so that the resulting harm would not have occurred "but for" the excepted peril's operation, the insurer would be exempt even though an insured peril was the proximate cause of the loss. Such a result would be directly contrary to the provision in section 530, in accordance with the general rule, for liability of the insurer where the peril {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p426"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 426*426}} insured against proximately resulted in the loss.' [Citation.]" ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 10 Cal.3d at p. 105, fn. 11}}.)\
Thus, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  and 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  stand for the following rule. When two risks, one included within the coverage of the policy and the other excluded, concur as proximate causes in producing a loss and are dependent \'97 i.e., when one sets the other in motion \'97 there is coverage if the included risk triggers the excluded, but not if the excluded triggers the included. When, however, the included and excluded risks concur as proximate causes in producing a loss and are independent \'97 i.e., when one does not set the other in motion \'97 coverage exists in all cases.\
I turn now to the case at bar. Under the 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella-Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  rule, the directed verdict was proper. It is the law that "Such a verdict may be properly granted if and only if, after disregarding conflicting evidence, and indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence in [the opposing party's] favor, it can be said that there is no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a jury verdict in [that party's] favor." ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17066780646073238235&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

\f0\i0  (1966) 65 Cal.2d 114, 120-121 [52 Cal. Rptr. 561, 416 P.2d 793]}}.) Here there was no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a determination in defendant's favor.\
Specifically, the evidence adduced at trial establishes without dispute that the included risk \'97 negligent construction \'97 and the excluded risk \'97 soil creep \'97 were independent: neither set the other in motion. Thus, there is no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a jury finding to the contrary. Contrary to the majority's assertion, this case clearly does 
\f2\i \strokec2 not
\f0\i0 \strokec2  "present[] a classic 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  situation." (Maj. opn. at p. 412, 
\f2\i \strokec2 ante.
\f0\i0 \strokec2 ) Indeed, the record is not as the majority represent. As stated above, defendant's expert Nelson testified in effect that both negligent construction and soil creep were direct and substantial causes of the loss to the room addition, but that neither could be termed the prime, moving, efficient, or predominant cause. Plaintiff's expert Hillebrandt testified that there was only one cause, negligent construction.\
The evidence also reveals \'97 as the trial court expressly held \'97 that negligent construction was a proximate cause of the loss as a matter of law. As stated above, plaintiffs' expert Hillebrandt and defendant's expert Nelson agreed that negligent construction was a direct and substantial cause of the loss. Thus, there is no evidence of sufficient substantiality to support a jury finding that negligent construction was not a proximate cause. It is true, as I recognized above, that the experts did not agree as to whether and if so to what extent soil creep played a part. But that disagreement is immaterial here: since the included risk of negligent construction was 
\f2\i \strokec2 a
\f0\i0 \strokec2  proximate {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p427"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 427*427}} cause of the loss, coverage existed under the policy even if the excluded risk of soil creep was also a proximate cause.\
The majority claim that 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  establishes a single "workable" rule of concurrent causation generally applicable to all cases \'97 i.e., a rule of "efficient proximate cause" or "predominating cause." (Maj. opn. at pp. 403-404, 
\f2\i \strokec2 ante.
\f0\i0 \strokec2 ) I cannot agree that 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  establishes such a rule: the very language of the opinion, quoted at length above, is to the contrary. Nor can I agree that such a rule would be "workable": to my mind, it is so totally devoid of standards as to allow \'97 indeed, encourage \'97 insureds always to claim coverage, insurers always to deny coverage, and juries always to decide between them arbitrarily.\
The majority also claim that 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  applies, and should apply, only to third party insurance policies. Again I cannot agree. Although the policy under consideration in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  happened to provide liability insurance, the court's discussion there does not suggest that the analysis is or should be limited to such policies; indeed, it cites and relies on first party and third party cases without distinction. Indeed, apparently no reported decision has ever found in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  the limitation the majority now "discover."\
Moreover, I do not find persuasive any of the arguments the majority present in support of limiting 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  to third party insurance policies. First, analysis of concurrent causation is not different for first party and third party policies. I recognize, of course, that such policies differ the one from the other: the former indemnifies the insured for losses he sustains directly when he suffers damage to or destruction of his own property; the latter indemnifies the insured for losses he sustains indirectly when he incurs liability to a third party. But I do not see how the analysis of concurrent causation differs between first party and third party policies. In my view, the same principles apply to the determination of coverage both when the insured suffers direct loss through the concurrence of an included risk (such as fire) and an excluded risk (such as earthquake) 
\f2\i \strokec2 and
\f0\i0 \strokec2  when the insured suffers indirect loss through the concurrence of an included risk (such as negligent use of a gun) and an excluded risk (such as negligent use of an automobile).\
Second, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  would not frustrate the reasonable expectation of the insurer and insured in a first party policy. The majority imply that it would be inappropriate to allow coverage when included and excluded risks concur as independent proximate causes of a loss. I strongly disagree. In my opinion, it is altogether appropriate to find the insurer liable when an 
\f2\i \strokec2 included
\f0\i0 \strokec2  risk \'97 i.e., a risk the insured has paid the insurer a premium to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p428"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 428*428}} assume \'97 is a proximate cause of the loss: in such a situation the insurer merely gives the insured the benefit of the protection he has purchased.\
Third, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  would not lead to a result unfair to the insurer. The majority assert that "if the rule in 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  ... were extended to first party cases, the presence of [an included risk] ..., no matter how minor, would give rise to coverage." (Maj. opn. at p. 408, 
\f2\i \strokec2 ante.
\f0\i0 \strokec2 ) Again I strongly disagree. As its very terms show, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  applies only when an included risk is a 
\f2\i \strokec2 proximate
\f0\i0 \strokec2  \'97 i.e., substantial \'97 cause.\
In the course of their discussion, the majority express general approval of the Court of Appeal majority opinion. I cannot concur.\
Crucial to the analysis of the Court of Appeal majority is their holding that 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  requires the concurrent causes to be independent in the sense that each is a sufficient condition of the loss. In 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  however, this court clearly stated: "[
\f2\i \strokec2 H
\f0\i0 \strokec2 ]
\f2\i \strokec2 ere both causes were independent of each other: the filing of the trigger did not `cause' the careless driving, nor vice versa.
\f0\i0 \strokec2  Both, however, caused the injury. In traditional tort jargon, both are concurrent proximate causes of the accident...." ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 10 Cal.3d at p. 104, fn. 10,}} italics added.)\
As the majority themselves recognize, it is plain from 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  that the causes of a loss must be independent only in the sense that each was of separate origin. In that case, the court held the two causes \'97 the insured's negligent modification of his pistol and his careless driving of his vehicle \'97 to be independent. Each was indeed of separate origin. But unlike, for example, the independent acts of the two motorcyclists who negligently rode past a man on horseback and caused the animal to run away and the man to be injured ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=18001822477423251411&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

The "traditional tort jargon" that the court used suggests the same limited scope of the "independence" requirement. "A `concurrent cause []' ... is a substantial cause which combines with another substantial cause to effect the loss, 
\f2\i \strokec2 neither being sufficient to do so alone."
\f0\i0 \strokec2  (Brewer,

Read against 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge,
\f0\i0 \strokec2  the Court of Appeal majority opinion is clearly wrong. First, its interpretation of 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  changes the definition that this court gave the term "independent" in its opinion. This court's words, which are quoted above, in no way suggest that to be "independent" a cause must constitute a sufficient condition of the loss in question. Second, the interpretation {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p429"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 429*429}} of 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  set forth in the Court of Appeal majority opinion, if applied to the facts of that case, would lead to a result opposite to that which this court reached. 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  contains no facts from which it could be concluded that either the negligent filing of the trigger or the careless driving of the vehicle constituted a sufficient condition of the injury in question. Under the interpretation of the Court of Appeal majority, there would have been no coverage in that case: the negligent filing of the trigger cannot be deemed the "moving" cause of the careless driving and hence could not be held to be the responsible cause of the loss.\
Moreover, even if the interpretation of 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  set forth in the Court of Appeal majority opinion were not clearly incorrect, I would be compelled to reject it as unworkable. As the dissenting member of the Court of Appeal soundly stated, "In order to comply with its new 
\f2\i \strokec2 independent cause
\f0\i0 \strokec2  requirement the majority returns this case for retrial, directing the jury to follow what can only be characterized as a maze-like analytical pattern which may yield an answer as to coverage or then again may not.... [\'b6] None of these results will, I suspect, further the cause of creating greater predictability in coverage cases or in limiting coverage to risks against which the parties sought to insure. Indeed, under the rule set out by the majority the writing of policy exclusions will become the most arcane of art forms. The policies so produced will only puzzle the insureds and engender more bad faith litigation. These problems need not arise, however, if we read 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  to mean what it holds, namely that there is coverage when an insured risk is a `concurrent proximate cause' of injury."\
Although the majority do not discuss the point, I recognize that if the matter were of first impression Insurance Code sections 530 and 532 (hereinafter sections 530 and 532) might be susceptible of an interpretation different from that which this court has previously adopted. Section 530 states: "An insurer is liable for a loss of which a peril insured against was the proximate cause, although a peril not contemplated by the contract may have been a remote cause of the loss; but he is not liable for a loss of which the peril insured against was only a remote cause." Section 532 states: "If a peril is specially excepted in a contract of insurance and there is a loss which would not have occurred but for such peril, such loss is thereby excepted even though the immediate cause of the loss was a peril which was not excepted." These provisions might perhaps be read as follows: When an included risk was the proximate cause of a loss, there is coverage whether or not a risk not specified in the policy was a remote cause of that loss; but when the included risk was only a remote cause, there is no coverage. When, however, an excluded risk was a cause in fact of a loss, there is no coverage whether or not the immediate cause of that loss was either an included risk or an unspecified risk.\

Applying the foregoing principles, I believe that the Legislature has given its approval to this court's interpretation of sections 530 and 532. First, the Legislature has acquiesced in that interpretation for more than three-quarters of a century. Second and more important, it has actively manifested its approval of those provisions as construed. To begin with, it has rejected attempts to amend or repeal those provisions as construed by this court. Moreover, it has enacted Insurance Code section 10088 as an exception to the general rule of sections 530 and 532, and thereby made plain the continuing viability of this court's interpretation of those provisions:

It follows from my discussion above that the Court of Appeal misread 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  and 
\f2\i \strokec2 Partridge
\f0\i0 \strokec2  and accordingly erred in concluding that the trial court's ruling on plaintiffs' motion for a directed verdict on the issue of coverage was improper.\
The Court of Appeal chose not to address the contentions other than those going to coverage evidently on the assumption that the judgment had to be reversed in its entirety as 
\f2\i \strokec2 necessarily
\f0\i0 \strokec2  predicated on a determination that the policy did in fact cover the loss in question. In so doing, however, it erred. In their complaint plaintiffs alleged facts, and at trial they introduced evidence, to support the jury's findings of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and its award of compensatory and punitive damages on grounds other than defendant's decision to deny the claim.\
Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remand the cause to that court with directions to address the noncoverage issues.\
BROUSSARD, J.\

The trial court properly granted a directed verdict on the coverage issue whether we view this case as one of concurrent causation or one of successive causation. If the case is viewed as one of concurrent causation, coverage is established by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16078869034298003410&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

Contrary to the majority opinion, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  does not establish that there can be no recovery in cases where the efficient cause is excluded and the immediate cause, the one which directly causes the loss, is insured. 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  did not involve an exclusion of the efficient cause. 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  merely points out that when the efficient cause is the excluded cause and the immediate cause is the insured cause the case is governed by Insurance Code section 532. A number of cases prior to 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  permitted recovery when the efficient cause was excluded and the immediate cause was the insured cause.

As to many of the excluded causes, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of a situation where the excluded cause and the insured cause could combine to cause a loss. Thus he may reasonably conclude that the insurer out of an abundance of caution has sought to make clear that there is no coverage where an excluded cause alone causes the loss and never turn his mind to the rare possibility that the excluded cause and the insured cause might combine to cause a loss. For example, an insured purchasing a fire policy on his home believes that, if his home burns, he will be paid; he does not think that the 25 or 50 exclusions in his policy exclude 25 or 50 types of fires unless the policy makes it abundantly clear either by express statement or necessary implication.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#%5B15%5D"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs20 \cf3 \super \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 [1]}} Accordingly, when the insured cause is the immediate cause of loss as in the fire illustration, coverage should exist unless the language of the policy makes it clear that coverage is excluded when the excluded occurrence causes the insured cause to in turn cause the loss.\
This principle, which has long been applied to policies that specify the risk, such as fire insurance policies which were the predecessor of the instant all-risk policy, should be generally applied to all-risk policies where the risks insured are not specified individually but only as the risks not excluded. To adopt a rule less favorable to the insured would render the "all risk" policy misleading. By its terminology this type of policy purports to broaden coverage as compared to a specified-risk policy covering the same type of losses. Further, the incentive for the insurer to read the coverage as mutually exclusive of the exclusions is greater because the format of the policy means that if a cause is not excluded it is an insured cause, so that if the loss were caused 
\f2\i \strokec2 solely
\f0\i0 \strokec2  by it there would be coverage. It is all the more reasonable for the insured to conclude that the purpose of the exclusion is to exclude losses caused solely by one or more of the excluded causes rather {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#p435"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 435*435}} than a purpose to exclude cases of multiple causation when an insured cause occurs.\

There the policy provided for recovery for personal injury caused by train wreckage but included within the long list of exclusions "injury resulting wholly or partly from any of the following to wit: ... explosives of any kind." ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=14384705676011660357&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 183 Cal. at p. 67}}.) The insured was seated in a passenger car of a train when a violent explosion occurred in the toilet room, with parts of the passenger car causing injury to the insured. The court reasoned: "If we must look for the cause of the injuries to the first cause, it would never be the wreckage of the car which is itself, a result and not a cause." ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=14384705676011660357&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 183 Cal. at p. 68}}.) The court went on to conclude that if the insured had been directly injured by a bomb placed in his lap which then exploded, the exclusion would have been effective to eliminate coverage but where the explosion caused parts of the wrecked car to injure the insured there was coverage under the established rule of construction requiring ambiguities to be construed in favor of the insured.

The court allowed recovery based on the language of the policy, contrary to the majority's rule which would exclude coverage whenever the efficient cause was excluded. Further, 
\f2\i \strokec2 Wilson
\f0\i0 \strokec2  points to the proper interpretation of the instant policy.\
In the instant case, the policy states: "This policy does not insure against loss: ... caused by, resulting from, contributed to, or aggravated by any earth movement, ..." The policy also excludes "loss: ... by ... settling, cracking, shrinkage...." The words refer to a "loss" related to the earth movement or other exclusions, and do not deal with a situation where the excluded causes do not themselves produce the loss but merely set in motion the insured cause which in turn causes the loss. The exclusion clause is ambiguous as to whether the excluded causes alone or in conjunction with other excluded causes limit coverage or whether coverage is also limited when the excluded cause sets in motion an insured cause which in turn causes the loss. An insured can reasonably conclude that only the former is excluded from coverage and that when the immediate cause is an insured cause there is coverage.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11895641390902034627&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5#%5B16%5D"}}{\fldrslt

But we are not architects or engineers who often work towards symmetry. As judges, our goal is to search for justice. The basic rules governing interpretation of insuring clauses and exclusion clauses discussed above make it clear that insuring clauses and exclusions are not treated equally, and there is no justification for symmetry.\
Moreover, if symmetry were a goal, the majority has it backward. Assuming that in multiple-cause cases we must choose between coverage where the insured cause is the efficient cause and where it is the immediate cause, common sense should tell us that there should be coverage when the immediate rather than efficient cause of loss is insured. An insured who has his house burn as a result of a fire from a nearby falling tree has a greater expectation that his fire insurance will provide coverage than he has when a fire causes the tree to fall crushing the house. But under the majority's rules, an exclusion for loss by falling trees will mean that the fire policy will provide coverage when the house is crushed but not when it burns.\
As 
\f2\i \strokec2 Sabella
\f0\i0 \strokec2  points out, a number of earlier decisions had held that the insured would recover when,' as in that case, the efficient cause was the insured cause. A number of other earlier cases had recognized that the insured would recover when the efficient cause was an excluded cause where the immediate cause was an insured cause, depending on the language of the policy. The language of insurance policies is not ordinarily directed to the multiple-cause situation and rarely specifies expressly or by clear implication that there is no coverage when an excluded cause sets in motion an insured cause which in turn causes the loss. Two Court of Appeal cases had observed generally that it "has been held that when two causes join in causing an injury, one of which is insured against, the insured is covered by the policy."

Today's decision in effect repudiates long-settled principles of insurance policy interpretation without discussing the applicable case law. Applying those long-settled principles, the trial court properly concluded that there was coverage as a matter of law and ordered a directed verdict on the coverage issue. It is unfortunate that the majority do not discuss or distinguish the applicable cases, and accordingly they err in affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\
I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\

\f2\i Williamsburgh
\f0\i0  bear little relationship to the issues discussed above. 
\f2\i Williamsburgh
\f0\i0  simply allowed the insured to recover damages for a fire "the remote cause of which was an earthquake" "on the peculiar phraseology of [a] particular policy, which made a distinction between loss caused `
\f2\i directly or indirectly
\f0\i0 ' by certain means other than earthquake and `loss or damage occasioned by or through' earthquake." ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=673014080029804398&q=proximate+cause+cases&hl=en&as_sdt=4,5"}}{\fldrslt

\f2\i Sabella,
\f0\i0  we approve of the fundamental principles of insurance law discussed in 
\f2\i Williamsburgh,
\f0\i0  we recognize that it would be unrealistic to discuss at length a case analyzing property policy language that is now obsolete.\
Finally, Justice Broussard's statement that "under the majority's rules, an exclusion for loss by falling trees will mean that the fire policy will provide coverage when the house is crushed but not when it burns" (dis. opn. by Broussard, J. at p. 436) ignores modern homeowners policy language which addresses fire loss specifically. For example, a direct loss to property by fire resulting from earth movement is typically covered. (See 2 Cal. Insurance Law and Practice (1987 ed.) \'a7 36 et seq., Appens. A-F, ISO Homeowners Standard Form Policies, at pp. 70-159.)\

The Insurance Services Office (ISO) issued new editions of its all-risk policies in October 1983 and stated in its "Explanatory Memorandum" accompanying the new policy forms that it redrafted the policies in an effort to preserve the effect of unambiguous policy exclusions. ISO's memorandum stated: "The following forms have been revised to restate policy intent. Recent court decisions have so interpreted policies that coverage has been found for losses that are not currently intended to be covered, and in such a way that, in the event of a major catastrophe, insurer solvency could be seriously threatened. The rates for these coverages simply do not contemplate such catastrophic perils." (2 Cal. Insurance Law and Practice, 
\f2\i supra,
\f0\i0  at \'a7 36.43.) Because the effect of the new language is unclear, we refer only to pre-1983 policies in our explanation of liability and property insurance coverage and the principles applicable to such policies.\

For example, if construction is undertaken on the insured premises for the sole purpose of protecting against the operation of a specifically excluded risk under the homeowner's policy, and that improvement subsequently fails to serve its purpose because it was negligently designed or constructed, the damage to the structure should arguably not be covered. On the other hand, ordinary negligence that contributes to property loss, but does not involve acts undertaken to protect against an excluded risk, may give rise to coverage under an all-risk policy. In other words, at some point, courts may want to distinguish between types of negligence when analyzing coverage in a first party property insurance context. The issue, however, was not raised in the present case, and we do not address it here.\

For example, if property loss were to result from the simultaneous crash of an aircraft into a structure (a covered peril in a typical all risk homeowner's policy) during an earthquake (typically excluded from coverage when it operates alone to cause a loss), it might be impossible to determine (under a 
\f2\i Sabella
\f0\i0  analysis) which cause was the efficient proximate cause of the loss. In that "novel" case, we might consider developing a doctrine similar to the present Court of Appeal's independent concurrent causation standard in analyzing coverage under the policy. It would be imprudent to reach such a hypothetical issue here, however, and hence we leave discussion of such a doctrine to a future first party property loss case, should one arise.\

Bragg, assistant counsel to State Farm Insurance Companies has stated: "[T]he insurance industry introduced several bills during the 1982 and 1983 legislative sessions which would have either repealed or amended both sections. These efforts were strongly opposed ... and each of the bills died early in the legislative process. [\'b6] Realizing that broad legislation to resolve concurrent causation had little chance of passage, the insurance industry focused its attention on the one peril whose catastrophic potential endangered its very solvency \'97 the peril of earthquake. Unsuccessful efforts were made during the 1983 session to legislatively exclude earthquake losses from property insurance policies which did not specifically cover earthquakes. Finally, some relief was achieved in 1984 with the passage of Assembly Bill 2865, which became effective on January 1, 1985[, codified as chapter 8.5 of the Insurance Code, section 10081 et seq.]."

When the policy insures specified risks, the exclusion will be effective in multiple-cause cases where the exclusion necessarily assumes existence of the insured cause. For example, in an automobile liability policy an exclusion of teenage drivers necessarily assumes that the insured cause, use of the automobile, is present. When the policy is an all-risk policy, the exclusion will be given effect when the asserted insured cause necessarily relates to the excluded cause. For example, when a homeowner's comprehensive liability policy excludes coverage for injuries arising out of the use and ownership of motor vehicles, the insurer is not liable for causes of action based on negligent entrustment because the alleged insured cause, negligent entrustment, is necessarily related to the use and ownership of the vehicle.

\f2\i Williamsburgh,
\f0\i0  we recognize that it would be unrealistic to discuss at length a case analyzing property policy 
\f2\i language
\f0\i0  that is now obsolete." (Maj. opn. at p. 403, italics added.)\
I agree that no purpose would be served by analyzing the 
\f2\i "obsolete" language
\f0\i0  of the 
\f2\i Williamsburgh
\f0\i0  policy. But we should analyze the 
\f2\i "modern" language
\f0\i0  of the exclusion clause in the policy before us under the fundamental principles of insurance law discussed in 
\f2\i Williamsburgh.
\f0\i0  I have done so above. However, the majority do not look at the language of the exclusion but, contrary to the fundamental principles, merely adopt an automatic rule denying recovery when the immediate cause is insured and the efficient cause is excluded.\
Both before and after 
\f2\i Sabella,
\f0\i0  coverage has been 
\f2\i held
\f0\i0  to exist in California decisions when the efficient cause was excluded. The majority cite no California case, before or after 
\f2\i Sabella,
\f0\i0  which 
\f2\i held
\f0\i0  that there was no coverage when the immediate cause of loss was the insured cause. In short, apart from the one ambiguous sentence in 
\f2\i Sabella,
\f0\i0  there is no precedent in California for the majority's rule, and every successive causation case where the immediate cause is insured has found coverage, contrary to today's majority holding.\
