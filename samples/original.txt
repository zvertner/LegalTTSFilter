    In Smith v. Jones, 123 U.S. 456 (2000), the Supreme Court held that 
    evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment is subject to the 
    exclusionary rule. See also United States v. Brown, 456 F.3d 789 (9th Cir. 2010).
    As the Court explained in Maryland v. King, 569 U.S. 435, 448 (2013), 
    "the ultimate measure of the constitutionality of a governmental search is reasonableness."
